## Dataset Description
Declear dddd

## Analyses tasks

Cell-based analysis
Plot rasters
Estimate mean spike rate (averaging window)
Plot mean spike rate for different trial types
    Extra credit - test for stationarity across the session
Compute selectivity as Sr(R) - Sr(L); do statistical test (bootstrapping or ranksum)
    Extra credit - Fano Factors
    Extra credit - does Fano Fat tor increase or decrease during the delay epoch?
Error trial analysis — preparatory activity vs working memory


### Plot rasters
### Plots mean spike rates – for different trial types
### Find task-modulated neurons
### Test if spike rates change across trial epochs
### Test if variance increases during the delay epoch
### Compute Fano Factors
### Average spike rates across sessions
### Dimensionality reduction method

#### compute CD

#### mode with max variance that is orthogonal to CD


### dPCA
