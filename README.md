## Dataset Description

## Analyses tasks

### Plot rasters
### Plots mean spike rates â€“ for different trial types
### Find task-modulated neurons
### Test if spike rates change across trial epochs
### Test if variance increases during the delay epoch
### Compute Fano Factors
### Average spike rates across sessions
### Dimensionality reduction method

#### compute CD

#### mode with max variance that is orthogonal to CD


### dPCA
