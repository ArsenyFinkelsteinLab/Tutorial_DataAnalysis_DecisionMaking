# explore ephys data
This is repo for the hand-on lecture on 08/21.
The goal of this lecture is to analyze extracellular electrophysiology data acquired during motor-planning task by using Matlab.
* See "Dataset Description" for descriptions of the behavioral task and data.
* See "Data access" for codes to load and access data.
* See rest of the sections for analysis to perform.


## Dataset Description
### Task description:
This is an extracellular electrophysiology data recorded during "Tactile delayed response task" in premotor cortex of mice.
Recordings were made with 64ch silicon probe.
* A pole is presented to whiskers of an animal during a "sample epoch". The location of pole instructs the animal which direction to lick (left or right). Because recordings were in left hemisphere, left and right are referred to as ipsi and contra directions.
* The sample epoch was followed by a "delay epoch", while the animal keeps memory of future licking direction.
* At the beginning of a "response poch", a brief "go cue" (100ms)instructs the animal to move.
* When the animal licks the correct direction it receives water reward (correct trials). When it licks the wrong direction, there is no reward (error trials). 
* Many neurons in premotor cortex show preparatory activity during the delay epoch. Let's analyze the preparatory activity both at single cell and population level.

### Task structure:
* Pre-sample : -3.1 to -2.6 sec.
* Sample     : -2.6 to -1.3 sec.
* Delay      : -1.3 to  0.0 sec.
* Response   :  0.0 to  2.0 sec.

### Data structure:
Here we have data from 5 recording sessions. In each session, we have hundreds of behavioral trials with different trial types. In each recording session, we have multiple units (neurons) recorded simultaneously.

* Spiking data is stored in an structure array named __ephysDataset__
* sessionIndex: index of the session in which neuron was recorded.  
* nUnit       : index of the neuron(unit) in each recording session.
* unit_yes_trial: spike rates in correct right-lick trial (contra-lateral behavior trial). Spikes were binned by 67 ms discretely in time.
* unit_no_trial : spike rates in correct left-lick trial (ipsi-lateral behavior trial). Spikes were binned by 67 ms discretely in time.
* unit_yes_trial_index: trial index of each correct right-lick trial.
* unit_no_trial_index : trial index of each correct left-lick trial.
* unit_yes_trial_spk_time: timing of each spike in correct right-lick trials (sec).
* unit_no_trial_spk_time : timing of each spike in correct left-lick trials (sec).

* unit_yes_error: spike rates in error right-lick trial. Spikes were binned by 67 ms discretely in time.
* unit_no_error : spike rates in error left-lick trial. Spikes were binned by 67 ms discretely in time.
* unit_yes_error_index: trial index of each error right-lick trial.
* unit_no_error_index : trial index of each error left-lick trial.
* unit_yes_error_spk_time: timing of each spike in error right-lick trials (unit in sec).
* unit_no_error_spk_time : timing of each spike in error left-lick trials (unit in sec).

* depth_in_um: recording depth of the unit in um. We don't use this info int this lecture.
* cell_type  : putative pyramidal cells -- 1; fast-spiking interneurons: 0.
* __timetag__    : timing of each bin (67 ms discrete time bins).


## Data access
#### Load data file
```matlab
load('ephysDataset.mat')
```

#### Get session and unit indices for a neuron
```matlab
    cell_idx = 100; % cell at 100th row of the ephysDataset array
    seesionInfo = ephysDataset(cell_idx).sessionIndex;
    unitInfo = ephysDataset(cell_idx).nUnit;
```
##### Extra
* Try the code for another neuron and report its recording session and its unit index.
* Try the code for the same neuron and report its location in depth and cell type.

#### Get spike counts for a neuron in one of lick-right trials
```matlab
cell_idx = 100; % cell at 100th row of the ephysDataset array
nTrial = 2; % the second lick-right trial
psth = ephysDataset(cell_idx).unit_yes_trial(nTrial,:);
```

timetag;
```

#### Get spike time for a neuron in one of lick-right trials
```matlab
cell_idx = 100; % cell at 100th row of the ephysDataset array
nTrial = 2; % the second lick-right trial
spkTime = ephysDataset(cell_idx).unit_yes_trial_spk_time{nTrial};
```

#### Run all analyses (see code tasks as follow)
```matlab
all_compiled;
```

## Cell-based analyses
### Plot rasters
* Plot each spike in a single trial as a dot (see also __Data access__ for detail)
```matlab
cell_idx = 100; % cell at 100th row of the ephysDataset array
nTrial = 10; % the second lick-right trial
spkTime = ephysDataset(cell_idx).unit_yes_trial_spk_time{nTrial};
figure;
plot(spkTime, ones(size(spkTime)), '.');
```

* Now plot spikes in all correct right and left trials. Trials arrayed in the vertical dimension, time in the horizontal dimension
* Example code and result are shown below.
```matlab
plot_raster
```

### Estimate mean spike rate for different trial types
* First we plot spike rates in a single trial of an example cell 
```matlab
cell_idx = 100; % cell at 100th row of the ephysDataset array
nTrial = 10; % the second lick-right trial
psth = ephysDataset(cell_idx).unit_yes_trial(nTrial,:);
figure;
plot(timeTag, psth);
```
* Extra - Create spike count 

* Next, plot mean peri-stimulus histogram (PSTH): average spike rates among trials using _mean_ function.
```matlab
cellId = 1; % cell to plot
meanR = mean(ephysDataset(cellId).unit_yes_trial,1); % mean PSTH of lick R trial
meanL = mean(ephysDataset(cellId).unit_no_trial,1);  % mean PSTH of lick L trial
figure
hold on
plot(timeTag,meanR,'b')
plot(timeTag,meanL,'r')
gridxy([-2.6 -1.3 0],'Color','k','Linestyle','--') ; % plot timing of each epoch
xlim([-3  1.5]); % range of X axis
xlabel('Time (s)')
ylabel('Spikes per s')
hold off
```

### Compute selectivity
* selectivity is defined as spike rate difference between two trial types
```matlab
meanR - meanL
```
* Plot selectivity of each neuron and do statistical test (ranksum test comparing two trial types)
* example code and result 
```matlab
plot_PSTH_with_selectivity
```
<img src='images/plot_contra_selectivity.png' width='500px'></img>
### Extra - Fano Factors
```matlab
plot_ff
```
* Fano factor for a trial-type at a time bin is defined as the variance of spike counts over its mean
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano_factor . To convert spike rate to spike counts, one needs to normalize
it with the size of the time bin (sampleRate) in the following code. For correct lick-right condition:
```matlab
sampleRate = 14.84;
meanR = mean(ephysDataset(cellId).unit_yes_trial,1)/sampleRate;
varR  = var(ephysDataset(cellId).unit_yes_trial,1)/sampleRate^2;
FF_R  = varR./meanR;
```
<img src='images/plot_ff.png' width='500px'></img>
* Extra - does Fano Factor increase or decrease during the delay epoch? Compare Sample epoch, Early Delay and Late Delay
### Error trial analysis â€” is activity similar or different?
* Run analyses above using error trials.


## Session-based analysis (i.e. across neurons recorded simultaneously in a session)

### Grand average --  spike rate (sr)
* Tips: using __for__ loop to compute mean spike rate for correct trials in lick-right and left conditions for each cell
* Tips: average across cells in each condition

<img src='images/plot_session_PSTH.png' width='500px'></img>
### Grand average selectivity,(correct trials only)
* Tips: Flip selectivity if it is negative during the delay epoch.

<img src='images/plot_session_contra_selectivity.png' width='500px'></img>
### Grand average, abs(sr(R) - sr(L))

* Example code
```matlab
plot_session_PSTH_with_selectivity
```

## Dimensionality reduction
### Find the coding direction - CD
* This is the direction in activity space where trial types can best be discriminated

* We will use the simplest definition:

 sr_R(i)-sr_L(i)

where sr_R is spike rate in lick-right trials, sr_L is spike rate in lick-left trials, and i is the cell index.
Calculate this vector for each time point, then normalize (divided by norm) to produce a unit vector.


* Explore correlation of coding direction across time

<img src='images/plot_coding_direction_correlation.png' width='500px'></img>

* Explore neural activity projected to coding direction
* To project population activity to CD, calculate inner dot: sr_R * CD.

<img src='images/plot_neural_activity_project_to_coding_direction.png' width='500px'></img>

* Do SVD; use Gram-Schmitt procedure to rotate the space to be orthogonal to CD using function __func_orthrog_vectors__
